## Overview

One of the most utilized algorithms in machine learning today is the recommendation system. This project focuses on a content-based recommendation system tailored specifically for music. By analyzing the lyrics of songs, our system predicts similar music tracks that users might enjoy based on their past preferences.

### How It Works

The system employs a **content-based filtering approach**, which means it recommends songs by understanding the content within song lyrics. This is achieved through the use of Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), a method that transforms text into a meaningful representation of numbers which our model can understand. We then apply cosine similarity to find songs with lyrics that are most similar to those the user already likes.

### Dataset

Our dataset comprises 7,000 randomly sampled songs, containing details such as the artist's name, song title, and lyrics. This rich dataset allows us to explore a wide variety of musical tastes and preferences.

### Getting Started

To explore how our recommendation system works, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and the necessary packages installed.
3. Run the recommendation script and follow the prompts to input your favorite song.

### Contribute

We welcome contributions! If you have suggestions on how to improve this system, feel free to make a pull request.
